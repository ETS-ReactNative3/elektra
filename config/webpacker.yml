  # NOTE:
  # there is a bug so the port and host from the webpacker config is not used and 
  # webpack-dev-server starts in any case with the default port 8081 
  # https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/5-x-stable/lib/webpacker/dev_server_runner.rb#L48
  # possible fix in execute_cmd
  # cmd += ["--port", @port.to_s]
  # cmd += ["--host", @hostname.to_s]
  #
  # Workarround:
  # a way to overwrite the port is to modify webpack_config -> config/webpack/custom.js -> extendConfig()
  # and use the same port that we use here in webpacker config
  # orgConfig.devServer = extendConfig.devServer || {}
  # orgConfig.devServer.port = 3000
